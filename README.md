## Game Principle

In Restaurant Rush, villagers enter your restaurant and place food orders. Your task is to deliver the correct dishes as quickly as possible. The faster you serve your customers, the better your score.

After guests finish eating, you also need to clean the tables — otherwise no new villagers will come in. Managing both speed and cleanliness is key to achieving a high score.

Food ingredients can be collected from different stations: the oven, the pantry, and the fridge. Knowing where to find each item is essential to serving customers quickly.

As time goes on, more and more villagers with more complex orders will enter the restaurant, making the game increasingly challenging. You’ll need to stay organized and work under pressure to keep everyone happy and maximize your score.
